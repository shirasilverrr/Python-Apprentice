"""

Copy the code from the previous lesson, 08a_More_Turtle_programs.ipynb, 
from the section "Change the Turtle Image"


Then change the code so that the turtle has a different image ( look in the 'images'
directory ) and moves to the corners of the screen in a square pattern. 
"""
'''
Here is an example of how you can change the look of the turtle to an image. 
You can copy the ``set_turtle_image()`` function into your own programs. 

Important:
* The image file must be a GIF. ( The file name ends in `.gif` )
* The image file must be in the `image` directory, and the  `image` directory
  must be in the same directory as your program.
